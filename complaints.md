# Sentiment By Stars

-  Not only is the information extremely valuable, its presented in a way that makes it easier to shop sustainably. I especially like the articles and reports on specific fabrics like silks.

-  I love reading the blog post, the fact that they go above and beyond to provide insight to brands, and I love that I can message the brand directly using the app! My only issues are that the filter button doesn't work at all,

- Harder if you are browsing, the filters don't seem to work, for example if you select dresses you still get shops that dont sell dresses. And also the price system is vague. A score of $$ can be anything between £20 for and item and £250 for an item

- It isnt perfect but still better than searching everything yourself which can take hours, so really can't complain for free! Very US centric right now, would be great if you could choose your region and see shops tailored to your country,

- I would also like it to have categories such as "Women, Men, Unisex, Kids" and a country category/filter, a lot of the things I find on there tend to be overseas, but I would like to shop within my country.

- for example I'll select "shorts" and "$$" as filters, but I'll get results for all prices and shops that don't sell shorts. It sounds like the developers hope to add some changes and I hope that includes MORE filters, and filtering that works!

- Initial thoughts are that it is an easy to use app. I found the Browse by Category to be the most useful. I would urge that asking for my Country, should then specialise my currency rather than default to $. For example: UK use £, Europe use € etc. Finally, I'd suggest that the feature of Feedback to a company to 'Do better' is a good concept, however, when I used it I got 'we will attempt to share this feedback with the company', it didn't inspire confidence that the message would be relayed.

- but I am noticing loading times are waaaaaay too long, if it even decides to load. At first I though it was my internet speed, but I could go on YouTube and play a video with the best quality no problem! 

- Would like more choices which are available in the UK, the ability to search by country would be good.

- I think that this is a great concept, its been such a useful aid for me to make better decisions about where I shop. It also allows you to send messages to brands who dont rate highly and I think this is really great in allowing you to be even more proactive. However, recently it has been really slow and wont load searches which makes the app unusable - please can you fix this?

-  Good concept behind the app, it is easy to use and looks professional. However there is too much wording on the pages (more images and videos please!), the similar brands offered are far too expensive and it hasn't really impacted my life at all.

### **2**
- If it ran smoothly I would give 5 stars. I really liked the app itself but after only using it a few times it no longer functions. I open it and try to search or really do anything and I just get the loading circle going indefinitely so I'm not actually able to use it at all.
